# Jorbites Instagram Giveaway Helper

Fetch comments from an Instagram giveaway post, extract `jorbites.com/recipes/{id}` links, tally valid entries per user (one entry per valid comment), and compute each participant's probability of winning.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Provide credentials via `.env` (auto-loaded):

```
IG_USERNAME=your_username
IG_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Usage

```bash
python giveaway.py \
  --post-url "https://www.instagram.com/p/DNDunraMPPb/"
```

- The script logs in with `IG_USERNAME`/`IG_PASSWORD` and fetches the postâ€™s comments.
- A comment is counted only if it contains a `https://jorbites.com/recipes/{id}` link.
- Each valid comment = 1 entry for that user.
- The terminal prints a compact, nicely formatted table with rank, username, entries, and probability.
